## Crafting a new attestation

To create a new attestation, submit a JSON formated request that contains an array of ipfs
items to the API endpoint `/attestation/submit/`. The format of the order is following:

  * An array called `ipfs` that contains an object `cid` which contains the IPFS CIDv1 of files you want to attest.
  * `pin_ipfs` boolean which states if you want Denotarius to pin these files.

         "cid":"QmP22VQJ3QH8fFtw6MkhidEVSvVSWruJd5r43VndVNrCKn"
      },
      {
         "cid":"QmVZgLKjFVfMzesyUx6R89GfE34Hk3P2sAss3gjcopFRJo"

Denotarius will return an information response that will contain details about your order,
including its payment credentials and status.

<Tabs items={['Mainnet', 'Preview testnet']}>
  <Tab>
```json filename="Response"
{
   "order_id": "7c883e0f-dcf2-4139-aafa-a4b33afc9c34",
   "payment": {
      "address": "addr_test1qqu2tz623r3lah4lt6mmuqv8uwxr0quapnufu57huts3qhhk6tew7wrnx0s4465nx05ajz890g44z0kx6a3gsnms4c4qc5asdh",
      "amount": "10000000"
   },
   "status": "unpaid",
   "time_limit_in_seconds": 1800,
   "tx_hash": null
}
```
	</Tab>
	<Tab>
```json filename="Response"
{
   "order_id": "7c883e0f-dcf2-4139-aafa-a4b33afc9c34",
   "payment": {
      "address": "addr1qqu2tz623r3lah4lt6mmuqv8uwxr0quapnufu57huts3qhhk6tew7wrnx0s4465nx05ajz890g44z0kx6a3gsnms4c4qc5asdh",
      "amount": "10000000"
   },
   "status": "unpaid",
   "time_limit_in_seconds": 1800,
   "tx_hash": null
}
```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

The response contains the following information:

	* The ID of your order
	* Payment details, mainly the address that you need to send the payment to and the amount
  * Status of the order (`unpaid` when pending the payment)
  * Time limit is seconds until the payment needs to be accepted on-chain
  * Transaction hash once the order is fullfilled

You can now pay for the order and check on its status in the next step.

## Viewing the attestation order

To view the attestation order, you need to have the `order_id` from the previous response.

<Tabs items={['Mainnet', 'Preview testnet']}>
  <Tab>
```fish filename="View order" copy
ORDER_ID="7c883e0f-dcf2-4139-aafa-a4b33afc9c34" # from the initial response
curl https://api.denotarius.io/attestation/${ORDER_ID}
```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
```fish filename="View order" copy
ORDER_ID="7c883e0f-dcf2-4139-aafa-a4b33afc9c34" # from the initial response
curl https://api.preview.denotarius.io/attestation/${ORDER_ID}
```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

The response of this command is the same as the Response above.
